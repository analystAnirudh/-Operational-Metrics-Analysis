# 📊 Operational-Metrics-Analytics - Using SQL  

## 📌 Project Overview  
Operational Analytics involves analyzing a company's end-to-end operations to identify areas for improvement. As a **Lead Data Analyst**, your goal is to derive meaningful insights from data, investigate metric spikes, and support decision-making for various teams like operations, support, and marketing.  

In this project, you will work with SQL to analyze real-world datasets, answer key business questions, and provide valuable data-driven insights.

## 📝 Case Study 1: Job Data Analysis  
You will be working with the **job_data** table, which contains:  
- **job_id**: Unique identifier of jobs  
- **actor_id**: Unique identifier of the actor  
- **event**: The type of event (decision/skip/transfer)  
- **language**: Language of the content  
- **time_spent**: Time spent reviewing the job (in seconds)  
- **org**: Organization of the actor  
- **ds**: Date (YYYY/MM/DD, stored as text)  

### 🔹 Tasks & SQL Queries  
✅ **Jobs Reviewed Over Time**: Calculate jobs reviewed per hour for each day in November 2020.  
✅ **Throughput Analysis**: Compute the 7-day rolling average of throughput (events per second) & compare it with daily metrics.  
✅ **Language Share Analysis**: Determine the percentage share of each language in the last 30 days.  
✅ **Duplicate Rows Detection**: Identify duplicate rows in the dataset.
